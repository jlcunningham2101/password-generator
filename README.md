## User Story

AS AN employee with access to sensitive data
I WANT to randomly generate a password that meets certain criteria
SO THAT I can create a strong password that provides greater security

## Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN I need a new, secure password
WHEN I click the button to generate a password
THEN I am presented with a series of prompts for password criteria
WHEN prompted for password criteria
THEN I select which criteria to include in the password
WHEN prompted for the length of the password
THEN I choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters
WHEN asked for character types to include in the password
THEN I confirm whether or not to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters
WHEN I answer each prompt
THEN my input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected
WHEN all prompts are answered
THEN a password is generated that matches the selected criteria
WHEN the password is generated
THEN the password is either displayed in an alert or written to the page

## Usage

- Users will click 'Generate Password. Then, they will be prompted with several inquiries to assist with generating a strong password. 'Ok' can be clicked if the user agrees to the password condition and 'Cancel' if they do not want that condition to be incorportated in their password.

The following conditions are prompts that the users will see to assist with password generation:
(a) choice of a character limit from 8 to 128,
(b) lowercase or uppercase letters,
(c) numeric values,
(d) special characters

Once these conditions are addressed, then a password that meets those conditions will be rendered to the webpage.
